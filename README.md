A wide collection of various DSA exercises that I have been practicing and experimenting with in my own time.
Also demonstrates working knowledge of Java Concurrency paradigms, Hibernate integrations with my own local Oracle XE database and much more.

I intend to use this repository as a sort of "sandbox" to continually improve my skills, to remain current in this field and ensure I am a competitive candidate for any potential opportunities that come my way :)

Note: I experimented with Docker and have surmised that it is effectively very similar to maintaining "manifest.yml" files with deployment and artifact instructions.
However, keeping Docker installed on my Windows PC didn't seem to play nice with other leisurely things I do in my spare time. For example, the Docker kernel-level VM was interfering with other kernel-level anti-cheat services used in games I play from time to time, causing BSODs, which was actually not surprising when you think about it.

I have instead kept Docker installed on my laptop should I ever need to experiment further.
